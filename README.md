# A-Simple-Password-Authentication-Script

Password Authentication
This script is a simple password authentication tool that prompts the user to enter a password and then checks if it matches the predefined password. If the passwords match, the user is granted access. If the passwords do not match, the user is denied access.

## Getting Started
1.	Download or simply copy script and place it in the file of your project
2.	Run the script by executing python3 passwd.py in your command line interface
3.	The script will prompt the user to enter a password
4.	If the password entered matches the predefined password, the user will be granted access and the message "Access Granted" will be displayed
5.	If the password entered does not match the predefined password, the user will be denied access and the message "Access Denied" will be displayed
6.	The script will then exit
## Customization
You can customize the script by modifying the predefined password in the following line of code:
if typed_password == 'password':

## Notes
â€¢	The correct password is hardcoded as 'password' in the script. Change this value to the desired password.
